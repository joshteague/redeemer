	      <p>One of the founding elders has lunch with a pastor from Atlanta to talk about a possible church plant in Marietta. The two families beginning the church trust in the belief that if God is making the details clear in their lives to start a church, then he will do the same in the life of a pastor to come and serve.</p>

	      <p>The two founding elders, founding pastor, and their wives meet every other week to discuss what a church might look like that preaches the sufficiency of Jesus’ work from every text of the Bible. During this time, and the subsequent two years, God worked through a handful of pastors and churches to support the foundation of Redeemer.</p>

	      <p>Twenty people begin gathering for prayer, worship, and Bible study on Thursday evenings in a dentist office. Over the next four months, while visitors come in and out of the Bible study, these individuals became the first parishioners of Redeemer. Simultaneously, Redeemer’s initial core families start meeting in a home on Sunday mornings for breakfast, worship, and a time of biblical teaching for their children. The simple acts of breaking bread, worshiping, and learning alongside our children facilitated a great sense of community. These Sunday mornings served as the organic model for Redeemer’s Family Worship service.</p>
